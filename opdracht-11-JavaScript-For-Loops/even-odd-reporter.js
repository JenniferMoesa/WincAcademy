/*
1. Even Odd Reporter
Write a loop that iterates from 0 to 20. During each iteration, check whether the current number is even or odd.
Use console.log to view the output.

Since this is your first looping exercise, use the following code to get started:

for (let i = 0; i <= 20; i++) {
  console.log(`Is ${i} even or odd?`);
  // TODO: determine if i is odd or even
  // TODO: use console.log
}

// Expected output:
// 1 is odd 
// 2 is even 
// 3 is odd 
// 4 is even 
// ...
Adjust the code as you see fit. To calculate whether a number is odd or even, check out the Remainder operator.
